Monthly Reports should be refreshed the first Thursday of the accounting month. This includes:
  1. Running the three codes located here: \\\prog1\east\wrkgrp\nfs\sas_prod\CNTL\SBI\RTB\CL Acquisition and SBI Monthly\
     - No changes are needed to the codes.
  2. Refreshing the Tableau dashboard (CL Acquisition and SBI Monthly Dashboard) saved in the same location as shown above.
     - Refresh the extract in the dashboard and publish it to the server, overwriting last month's report.
  3. Refreshing the Excel report (SBI Partner Product_Carrier Details_YYYYMM)
     - Saved here: \\\prog1\east\wrkgrp\CNTL\SBI\PROJECTS\High-Level Dashboards\CL Acquisition and SBI Monthly Dashboard\
     - Refresh all pivots and "save as" the file with the current month's name.

Check figures against other dashboards reporting on similar metrics before sending the reports out.
